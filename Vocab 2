The candid (honest) journalist, known for exposing calumny (false accusations/slander),
began her report with alacrity (eagerness), hoping to advocate (support/stand for) for truth.
She accused a corrupt minister of trying to aggrandize (increase power) his influence by
accepting bribes and even attempting to adulterate (make impure) evidence.

The minister, pretending to be benign (harmless/kind), gave a derivative (copied/unoriginal)
speech full of banal (boring/commonplace) lines, but his craven (cowardly) supporters
launched a diatribe (bitter verbal attack) against her. Their caustic (sarcastically harsh)
remarks were meant to confuse the public and construe (interpret) her honesty as lies.

Still, she remained amenable (willing/cooperative) to dialogue, although ambivalent
(mixed feelings) about whether anything would ameliorate (improve) the situation.
Meanwhile, an avaricious (greedy) businessman, wearing an anachronistic (out of its time)
gold chain, made an audacious (bold/fearless) attempt to covet (desire something not yours)
government land.

His plan was so convoluted (complex/twisted) that even the media looked incredulous
(unable to believe). When confronted, he pretended to be contrite (deeply sorry), but his
dry explanation sounded as desiccated (completely dried out) as the desert.

The only person who behaved with true decorum (proper behavior) was a deft (skilled/quick)
young lawyer. When asked to defend the corrupt minister, he demurred (politely objected),
refusing to help someone so shameless. His ingenuous (innocent/naive) intern, however,
was shocked at how brazen (shamelessly bold) powerful people could be.
