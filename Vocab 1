Mini-Story Using All Words

The taciturn (quiet) monk lived an austere (simple) life in a small hut. One day, he tried to placate (calm) a 
capricious (unpredictable) traveler who complained in a loquacious (talkative) manner.
The traveler flouted (ignored) the rules, and in a didactic (teaching) tone, the monk warned him not to 
belie (hide) his fears behind loud words.

The traveler, not very cerebral (intellectual), spoke of his humdrum (boring) job and his 
quixotic (idealistic, unrealistic) dream of becoming rich. He was followed everywhere by 
an obsequious (overly obedient) sycophant (flatterer) who praised even his insipid (dull) jokes.

The monk smiled gently, almost genial (friendly), despite knowing the traveler 
secretly deified (treated like god) himself. The monk noticed his proclivity (tendency) 
toward wastefulness—he was a spendthrift (extravagant spender) unlike the monk, who 
was thrifty (saves money).
Nearby lived a miser (person who hoards money) whose wealth 
abounds (exists in large amount) in locked chests.

A misanthropic (antisocial, hates people) hermit, with an 
amorphous (shapeless) cloak, watched them from afar, 
muttering puerile (childish) insults in a cursory (quick) whisper 
before disappearing into the woods.
